# Welcome to a mini Minecraft demo built with React Three Fibre

This project was just me attempting to build a Minecraft Demo with ReactJS.

To build this project I followed a tutorial by [freeCodeCamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and [Daniel Bark](https://www.youtube.com/c/barelycoding). You can find it here:

Feel free to check it out and build your own project. It's super fun.

Here's the link to my live demo: https://mcraft.apps.ochuko.space/

## How to play.

Currently it has 5 types of blocks: Grass, Wood, Log, Glass and Dirt.
You can switch block types with numbers 1-5 on your keyboard.

To navigate the world use a mouse to turn, `WASD` keys to move in a direction and the `Space bar` to jump.

To add blocks `Click` and to remove blocks hold the `ALT` key then `Click`.

To store the world in your local storage `SHIFT`+`Q`. Tapping the keys one after the other will work as well.

To reset the world `SHIFT`+`R`. Tapping the keys one after the other will work as well.

## How to run locally.

In the command line in the project directory run:

`npm install`

This will install all the dependencies needed to run the project.

After which you run:

`npm start`

To start the server.

This will run the app in development mode and automatically open the browser on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
